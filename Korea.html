                </div>
                <p>South Korea is a remarkable country filed with alluring beaches,flourishing cities,ancient teemples,wondrous natural scenery and especially friendly people.It has almost been over 9 months of my arrival in Korea.I reside in Busan which offers some of the best contemporary architectural buildings and hotels in Korea.Staying in Korea has taken a toll in my life as I had gone through a lot of different phases and states despite my young age and also had enlightened me in many ways.I am constantly learning,discovering and exploring Korea,endeavouring for a better future. </p>
